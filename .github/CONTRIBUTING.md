## Dev Setup

I think the fastest way to get going, is by runnin `npm run dc:up` or `docker-compose up -d`. This starts a mongodb and redis container so you can use them for bot development. 

## Code Style

[WIP] use prettier + eslint

## Commit Style

Please use commitizen since I want to use standard-release. Since this is open source software, emoji-cz is also fine :D

Please also try to make meaningful descritpions for your pull requests.

## Branches
