# Privacy Policy 

## What data is stored?

I only store the bary minimum of data that I have to store for the bot to work. That means I'm storing **guild ids**, **message ids** and the contents of the todos/tasks submitted by users. 

## What data is not stored?

- **Message Contents** I only need to store the message ids of the messages that the bot posted with the users todo/task.
- **Any Guild Member related data** The permission system of the bot uses roles so I dont have to store user ids and guild members have full privacy. However, if they sumbit a todo, their user id will be saved with the todo object.

## Is my data safe with you?

Yes.

## How can you be so sure?

I follow best practices when it comes to securing and monitoring my servers and or applications properly. There are also multiple intrusion detection systems in place.
